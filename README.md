When creating classes ensure to include a summary at the top of them (quickly triple click "/" to make a simple template in VS Community)

Add Notes beside a method,function, and some harder to understand inline pieces of code in your header and definition files (.h/.cpp) so others can better understand what it's purpose is

Ensure when creating new files to add them to the correct folder (headers/src/extern) you see this when creating a new file at the bottom which dir you are working in - if created in the wrong folder "remove" the file from project and move it manually in file explorer to the correct folder then add existing file back into VS in the correct filter.
